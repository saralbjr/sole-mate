## Backend Integration

This frontend application is designed to connect with a backend API. Currently, it uses static data for demonstration purposes. To integrate with a backend:

1. Replace the static imports from `/data` with API calls
2. Create service files in a new `/services` directory to handle API communication
3. Implement state management with Context API or Redux as the application scales

## Deployment

To build the project for production:

```
npm run build
```

or with yarn:

```
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `build` folder that can be deployed to your hosting provider.
